# PewPewLive deprecated level - Otvazhnaya
A project abandoned for many different reasons, one of them being the memory limitations.

The TODO list prior to discarding this project looks something like the following:
- Rework of daily income (salary and deductions) and addition of missing tax notices
- Complete overhaul of the weapon system
- Add elite poleaxe mesh, then debug and balance its functionality
- Implement gameover upon two-day bankrrupcy
- Create the missing enemy entities (two standard enemies, one chance-based encounter, a miniboss and a boss)
